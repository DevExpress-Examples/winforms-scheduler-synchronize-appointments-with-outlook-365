# Synchronize User Appointments with Microsoft 365 Calendars

The [DevExpress WinForms Scheduler](https://www.devexpress.com/products/net/controls/winforms/scheduler/) allows you to synchronize user appointments with Microsoft 365 Calendars (bi-directionally). You can export appointments from the Scheduler control to Microsoft 365 calendars, import Microsoft 365 events to the Scheduler control, or merge the Scheduler control's appointments with Microsoft 365 calendars.

This demo application demonstrates how to synchronize user appointments with Microsoft 365 calendars (import, export, merge), resolve merge conflicts, and save changes to a data source.
